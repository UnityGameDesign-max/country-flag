## How to set up and run the project

* run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies of the project
* run `npm run dev` to run the project locally on your machine

## How I Approached the problem

* I adopted a certain architecture for my solution. I went with a certain file structure that will ensure that continuous development and possibly deployment is possible should I decide I want to continue and add more features to the solution.
I solve the solution using a JavaScript framework React and a CSS framework Material UI.

* I would be interested in adding more features to the application I enjoyed solving a grid system and using dynamic data from an external API to determine if a grid is safe of under maintenance. I would add a feature to show additional information once hovered over like a status/activity of a dinosaur zone or grid.

* I learned generating grids dynamically and using an API to manipulate some other grids and learned documenting styles that can be used for documentation to be easy for someone to run the project locally

* I think the assessment can be improved by explaining clearly which zones or grids are needed to be manipulated from an API it can be a list stating clearly that if 'dino_added' manipulate grid to be green and give a specific location as well. I needed clarity on which zone is safe or unsafe from the API endpoint.
